AutoHotKey Remap Script Generator is, as the name suggests, a program that generates AutoHotKey scripts for remapping keys.

Useful when a program doesn't allow remapping or for pranks. Note, though, that this application only generates the scripts that are used by AutoHotKey, it does not execute them.

AutoHotKey is available freely at http://www.autohotkey.com/download/
