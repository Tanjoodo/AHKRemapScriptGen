Introduction
============

AutoHotKey Remap Script is, as the name suggests, a program that generates AutoHotKey scripts for remapping keys.

Usage
-----

Using the program is easy, for example, if you want the W key to be pressed when you press the up arrow key, 
you put "Up" in the left textbox and "W" in the right textbox, then press Enter or click "Add Entry". Repeat the process for each key you want to remap. 

To delete an entry, simply select it and either right click on it and choose "Delete Entry" or click the "Delete" button at the bottom right.

To save your script to disk, click the Save button, choose the location and click Save. It's pretty straightforward, actually.

Notes
=====

Note the this program is only a generator, it does not execute the script. To execute it, you will need to download AutoHotKey at http://www.autohotkey.com/download

Also note that messing with letter keys will make it impossible to use those letters unless you disable your script.

License
=======
Do whatever you want with the code, it isn't really worth any license.
